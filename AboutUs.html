<p class="lede">We are a group of software practitioners, working in large organisations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eppur si muove</p>

Over the years, we have seen much value in Lean and Agile ways of working, but are increasingly dissatisfied with them as they - and their proponents' rhetoric - often don't speak to our needs and those of our organisations. Too much <q>"should and must"</q> and <q>"won't and can't"</q> and not enough actual experience of what actually helps.

We want to talk with others with similar experiences to see how we can find better ways of delivering business value through software in our kinds of organisations.

Right now, 'we' are:

<ul>
	<li>Chris Matts </li>
	<li>Martin Burns</li>
	<li>Tony Grout</li>
	<li>Marina Oliviera</li>
</ul>
Our vision is that our group will grow as our fellow practitioners start talking from real experience.
