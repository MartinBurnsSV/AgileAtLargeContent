<p class="lede">Agile and Lean for Software are great! They both provide excellent guidance on how to run a team or small company. Unfortunately not all companies that want to adopt Agile and Lean for Software are small.</p>
Even worse, there is no way of shrinking the company down to a level that is manageable by the team level approaches. Great thinkers and Experts will tell you their thoughts but the reality is that <strong>for organisations working at scale, Agile is off the map</strong>. It is currently in the age of exploration. Like explorers used the map above, often the map might be useful in some ways but fundamentally flawed in others.
At the time of exploration, there will always be experts who will tell you everything about the new discovery even though they have never been there. Of more value is to speak to fellow explorers. Others who are exploring the same uncharted lands. Things that are safe (like wearing bright clothing so you can be found) in one context might be deadly in another (as the predators can find you more easily).

<h2>A conference for organisations to share their experience at Scaling Agile.</h2>
<p class="lede">Agile@Large is a conference for bringing fellow explorers together so that they can share tips and experiences. To identify which of the advice of experts (who have never been to our land) is safe or otherwise. To listen to our own pioneers.</p>
<h3>Conference Outline</h3>
To ensure the most valuable exchange of ideas for all involved, we propose the following structure for the conference:
<h4>Attendee Criteria</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Companies must be larger than the top Dunbar number (150 developers) to attend.</li>
    <li>
        Each company attending should have a minimum of
        <ul>
            <li>a Manager of Managers,</li>
            <li>a Non-projects Business Person</li>
            <li>an Agile Expert to ensure the material is new.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To ensure good behaviour of all participants, all attendees will be the representative of a company. There will be no self-representing individuals or consultants present, which applies even to the theme shepherds.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Structure</h4>
<ol>
    <li>A two day conference, with the morning consisting of experience reports, and the afternoon as an open space to discuss any issues raised. The conference will focus on everything with the exclusion of team level techniques and tools.</li>
    <li>
        The experience reports will be grouped into themes. Each theme will have a shepherd who will help the presenter to bring the best out in their story, and bring the presenters together. The presenters will help with peer review. Current Themes include:
